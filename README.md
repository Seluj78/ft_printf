## ft_printf [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Seluj78/ft_printf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Seluj78/ft_printf)

# About
This repository hosts my rework of printf

# How it works:

Just like the real one, well almost, it's missing a few features that'll be added over time

# Installation:

You need my libft to be able to use the ft_printf function.

I recommend checking out https://github.com/Seluj78/libft for more information

# Usage:

Just like a normal printf in C:

`ft_printf("Here's a string %s and here's an integer %d\n", "I AM A STRING", 42);`
